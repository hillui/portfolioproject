        <b><h2>iat 336 - <b>AHERA (2018).</b></h2></b>

        <p>Product design project on desk lamp with Christy Liu, Taralyn Karras, Yoher Wang.</p>
        <h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<p> The Ahera Lamp, meaning “growth” in Maori, is a reading lamp that has a calming form inspired by the concept of nature in an indoor setting. With the incorporation of wood and fabric, the Ahera Lamp is intended to reduce stress by creating a tranquil atmosphere. The arm of the lamp is kerfed to allow the user to adjust the direction of light coming from the lamp and the base of the arm can rotate. The dangling of fabric leaves help diffuse the light while decorating the lamp as well. A spring is also used for the power button, in order for the user to easily turn the lamp on and off. The base and arm are made of pine wood, and cotton fabric is used as decoration. Wood vessels with plants can be lifted and separated from the base for ease of use and flexibility in design. </p>

<h3>FORM + PROCESS</h3>

<p>For our final design, we were inspired by the concept of nature in an indoor setting. We wanted the lamp to have space for small plants in wood vessels while still having a simple shape. Throughout the iterations, we added more flexibility to the form, allowing for rotation and bending.The arm is able to bend through the kerfing, creating an elegant pattern. The fabric leaves that dangle brings in the beauty of plants while diffusing light. The slant on the base and the small legs beneath create balance. The hexagon shapes add uniqueness and contrasts with the overall form. </p>

<h3>FABRICATION</h3>
<p>Laser Cutting: Used for kerfing the arm, cutting out the hexagon vessels and indents, and the swivel. </p>
<p>Bandsaw: For cutting the wood shorter. Sander: For smoothing and shaping the wooden arm, base, and hexagon vessels.</p>

<h3>INTERACTION</h3>
<p>For adjustability of the direction of light, the arm of the lamp is kerfed and the base of the arm can rotate. The power button allows for the user to easily turn the lamp on and off by pressing. Wood vessels with plants can be lifted and separated from the base for ease of use and flexibility in design. The lightness of the material used makes it easier to carry and move around.</p>

<h3>MATERIALS</h3>
<p>Wood (Pine): The smoothness and unique patterns on wood helps the form feel more natural. As our wood is light, the lamp is easy to carry and move. Wood is also easy to work with, especially with laser cutting, shaping, and joining. Pine wood would be preferred with its softness, lightness, good elasticity, and resistance to shrinking and swelling. Kerfing allows for bending while having a unique pattern. Our alternative material is MDF, which is best used for kerfing as it is extremely flexible. Overall, wood fits our persona the most.</p>
